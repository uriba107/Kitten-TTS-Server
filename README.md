## 🗣️ Overview: Enhanced KittenTTS Generation

The [KittenTTS model by KittenML](https://github.com/KittenML/KittenTTS) provides a foundation for generating high-quality speech from a model smaller than 25MB. This project elevates that foundation into a production-ready service by providing a robust [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) server that makes KittenTTS significantly easier to use, more powerful, and drastically faster.

We solve the complexity of setting up and running the model by offering:

- A **modern Web UI** for easy experimentation, preset loading, and speed adjustment.
- **True GPU Acceleration** for NVIDIA GPUs, a feature not present in the original implementation.
- **Large Text Handling & Audiobook Generation:** Intelligently splits long texts into manageable chunks, processes them sequentially, and seamlessly concatenates the audio. Perfect for creating complete audiobooks.
- **A flexible, dual-API system** including a simple endpoint and an OpenAI-compatible endpoint for easy integration.
- **Built-in Voices:** A fixed list of 8 ready-to-use voices for consistent and reliable output.
- **Cross-platform support** for Windows and Linux, with clear setup instructions.
- **Docker support** for easy, reproducible containerized deployment.

## 🍓 Raspberry Pi & Edge Device Support

The ultra-lightweight nature of the KittenTTS model and the efficiency of this server make it a perfect candidate for running on single-board computers (SBCs) and other edge devices.

- ✅ **Raspberry Pi 5 (RP5):** Confirmed to run with **excellent performance**. The server is fast and responsive, easily handling requests from other devices on the same local network (LAN). This makes it ideal for local network services, home automation, and other DIY projects.

```

> **⏱️ Important:** During the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step, some Python packages (especially audio processing libraries like `librosa`, `praat-parselmouth`, and others) may need to be compiled from source on ARM architecture. This process can take **15-30 minutes** depending on your SD card speed and system load. This is normal - let it complete without interruption.

#### **Raspberry Pi 4 - Limited Support ⚠️**

**Raspberry Pi 4 support is currently in development** due to complex dependency compilation issues on 32-bit ARM architecture.

**Known Technical Challenges:**

- **ONNX Runtime:** No official ARM wheels available on PyPI
- **PyTorch Ecosystem:** Limited pre-built wheel availability for armv7l
- **NLP Dependencies:** SpaCy and related libraries fail to compile due to architecture detection issues
- **Audio Processing:** Some native audio libraries require manual compilation

**Current Status:**

- ✅ **64-bit Raspberry Pi OS:** May work with standard installation (limited testing)
- ⚠️ **32-bit Raspberry Pi OS:** Requires complex manual dependency resolution
- 🔧 **Alternative Solutions:** Being developed for core functionality

**For Raspberry Pi 4 Users:**
We recommend upgrading to **64-bit Raspberry Pi OS** if possible, as this significantly improves compatibility with modern Python packages. For users requiring 32-bit support, please check our [GitHub Issues](link-to-issues) for the latest progress updates and community-contributed solutions.

**Alternative Recommendation:**
For the best Raspberry Pi TTS experience, we strongly recommend using a **Raspberry Pi 5** with the standard 64-bit OS, which provides excellent performance and full compatibility.

## 🐳 Docker Installation

Run Kitten-TTS-Server easily using Docker. The recommended method uses Docker Compose, which is pre-configured for both CPU and NVIDIA GPU deployment.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed.
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).
- **(For GPU acceleration)**
  - An NVIDIA GPU.
  - Up-to-date NVIDIA drivers for your host operating system.
  - The [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) installed.

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method uses the provided `docker-compose.yml` files to automatically build the correct image and manage the container, volumes, and configuration.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devnen/Kitten-TTS-Server.git
cd Kitten-TTS-Server
```

**2. Start the Container Based on Your Hardware**

Choose one of the following commands:

#### **For NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for Performance):**

The default `docker-compose.yml` is configured for NVIDIA GPUs. It will build the image with full CUDA support.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

#### **For CPU-only:**

This uses a dedicated compose file that builds the image without GPU dependencies.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yml up -d --build
```

⭐ **Note:** The first time you run this, Docker will build the image and the server will download the KittenTTS model, which can take a few minutes. Subsequent starts will be much faster.

### 3. Access and Manage the Application

- **Access the Web UI:** Open your browser to `http://localhost:8005`
- **Access the API Docs:** `http://localhost:8005/docs`

- **View Logs:**

  ```bash
  # For GPU or CPU version
  docker compose logs -f
  ```

- **Stop the Container:**
  ```bash
  # This stops and removes the container but keeps your data volumes
  docker compose down
  ```

### How It Works

- **Build-time Argument:** The `Dockerfile` uses a `RUNTIME` argument (`nvidia` or `cpu`) to conditionally install the correct Python packages, creating an optimized image for your hardware.
- **Persistent Data:** The `docker-compose` files use Docker volumes to persist your important data on your host machine, even if the container is removed:
  - `./config.yaml`: Your main server configuration file.
  - `./outputs`: All generated audio files are saved here.
  - `./logs`: Server log files for troubleshooting.
  - `hf_cache` (Named Volume): Persists the downloaded Hugging Face models, saving significant time on rebuilds.

### Verify GPU Access (for NVIDIA users)

After starting the GPU container, you can verify that Docker and the application can see your graphics card.

```bash
# Check if the container can see the NVIDIA GPU
docker compose exec kitten-tts-server nvidia-smi

# Check if PyTorch inside the container can access CUDA
docker compose exec kitten-tts-server python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
```

If `CUDA available:` prints `True`, your GPU setup is working correctly

## 💡 Usage Guide

## 📖 API Documentation

The server exposes two main endpoints for TTS. See `http://localhost:8005/docs` for an interactive playground.

### Primary Endpoint: `/tts`

This endpoint offers the most control.

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "text": "Hello from the KittenTTS API!",
    "voice": "Leo",
    "speed": 1.0,
    "output_format": "mp3",
    "split_text": true,
    "chunk_size": 300
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Streaming audio file (`audio/wav`, `audio/mp3`, etc.).

### OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint: `/v1/audio/speech`

Use this for drop-in compatibility with scripts expecting OpenAI's TTS API structure.

- **Method:** `POST`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "model": "kitten-tts",
    "input": "This is an OpenAI-compatible request.",
    "voice": "Luna",
    "response_format": "wav",
    "speed": 0.9
  }
  ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

All server settings are managed in the `config.yaml` file. It's created automatically on first launch if it doesn't exist.

**Key Settings:**

- `server.host`, `server.port`: Network settings.
- `tts_engine.device`: Set to `auto`, `cuda`, or `cpu`. The server will use your GPU if set to `auto` or `cuda` and a compatible environment is found.
- `generation_defaults.speed`: Default speech speed (1.0 is normal).
- `audio_output.format`: Default audio format (`wav`, `mp3`, `opus`).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **Phonemizer / eSpeak Errors:**
  - This is the most common issue. Ensure you have installed **eSpeak NG** correctly for your OS and **restarted your terminal** afterward. The server includes auto-detection logic for common install paths.
- **GPU Not Used / Falls Back to CPU:**
  - Follow the **NVIDIA GPU Installation** steps exactly. The most common cause is `torch` being installed without CUDA support.
  - Run the verification command from the installation guide to confirm `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `True`.
- **"No module named 'soundfile'" or Audio Errors on Linux:**
  - The underlying system library is likely missing. Run `sudo apt install libsndfile1`.
- **"Port already in use" Error:**
  - Another application is using port 8005. Stop that application or change the port in `config.yaml` (e.g., `port: 8006`) and restart the server.
